[**gvm**](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) is a version manager for the Go programming language. Unfortunately **gvm** does not support Windows.

This script provides a partial emulation of the CLI of [**gvm**](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) to allow the same commands to be used for management of Go version on all platforms.
